# My-Perspective
This is my perspective on the whole "Raven and TheAdminHammer" situation


Raven, if you send threats in my DMs or anything like that, I'll simply block you and upload screenshots here.

# Part 1 - The scamming.

Raven is a scammer. He tried to scam me once, and has scammed other people. screenshots of this: ![image](https://github.com/CrimsonfiedOfficial/My-Perspective/assets/122784385/7c1dad22-59bb-49b8-b177-9f45221a382f)

Raven didnt want me to find out about pls donate utils and stuff like that, including ctp but i'll get to that later. Raven taking advantage of me after hearing my pc specs: ![image](https://github.com/CrimsonfiedOfficial/My-Perspective/assets/122784385/5876bfad-e6d4-4e32-8eac-e8d65bcef7e6)

# Part 4 - CTP

### Hammers Perspective on CTP
Raven made the idea of CTP as a tool to farm after byfron release, from my experience, he is a horrible business partner, when i was still coding CTP he already made a very early release date which forced me to literally break my sleep schedule by a ton, when the release date he promised was there, the software wasn't even done, instead he let people preorder the software when i wasn't even done with AutoLaunch + AutoInject. This pushed me even more and even got a bunch of people mad because we had "4" devs and it was taking a while for us to finish, the reality is i was the only one coding major parts of the project like AutoLaunch, AutoInject, CacheCleaner, Massconfig, and a bunch more, All Raven did was basic stuffs which anyone can do in less than 5 minutes with ChatGPT.

### Mad respect to theadminhammer for not letting out his anger.
You can clearly see how badly Hammer was fustrated by Ravens actions. I dont know how raven didnt look back and feel bad for hammer, not even realising what he did.
