# My-Perspective
This is my perspective on the whole "Raven and TheAdminHammer" situation


Raven, if you send threats in my DMs or anything like that, I'll block you and upload screenshots here.


Part 1 - The scamming.

Raven is a scammer. He tried to scam me once, and has scammed other people. screenshots of this: ![image](https://github.com/CrimsonfiedOfficial/My-Perspective/assets/122784385/7c1dad22-59bb-49b8-b177-9f45221a382f)

Raven didnt want me to find out about pls donate utils and stuff like that, including ctp but i'll get to that later. Raven taking advantage of me after hearing my pc specs: ![image](https://github.com/CrimsonfiedOfficial/My-Perspective/assets/122784385/5876bfad-e6d4-4e32-8eac-e8d65bcef7e6)
