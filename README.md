# My-Perspective
This is my perspective on the whole "Raven and TheAdminHammer" situation

## To be honest, Hammer is a nice guy. Raven is just a fuckwit.

Raven, if you send threats in my DMs or anything like that, I'll simply block you and upload screenshots here.

# Part 1 - The scamming.

# Part 4 - CTP

### Hammers Perspective on CTP
Raven made the idea of CTP as a tool to farm after byfron release, from my experience, he is a horrible business partner, when i was still coding CTP he already made a very early release date which forced me to literally break my sleep schedule by a ton, when the release date he promised was there, the software wasn't even done, instead he let people preorder the software when i wasn't even done with AutoLaunch + AutoInject. This pushed me even more and even got a bunch of people mad because we had "4" devs and it was taking a while for us to finish, the reality is i was the only one coding major parts of the project like AutoLaunch, AutoInject, CacheCleaner, Massconfig, and a bunch more, All Raven did was basic stuffs which anyone can do in less than 5 minutes with ChatGPT.

### Screenshot taken directly from Hammers Readme (link at the top)

### Mad respect to theadminhammer for not letting out his anger even tho he had EVERY RIGHT to do so.
You can clearly see how badly Hammer was fustrated by Ravens actions. I dont know how raven didnt look back and feel bad for hammer, not even realising what he did.
